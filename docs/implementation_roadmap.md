# Recognition Science Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of the Recognition Science framework based on the manuscript "Recognition Science: The Parameter-Free Ledger of Reality". The framework promises **zero free parameters** - all physical constants derive from eight axioms and a universal cost functional.

## Key Principles

### The Universal Cost Functional
```
J(x) = ½(x + 1/x)
```
This is the heart of Recognition Science - a dual-recognition symmetry that ensures every observation has a complementary cost.

### The Eight Axioms

1. **A1 (Observation Alters Ledger)**: Recognition transfers finite cost ΔJ from potential to realized ledger
2. **A2 (Dual-Recognition Symmetry)**: Every ledger change has a conjugate that restores balance
3. **A3 (Cost-Functional Minimization)**: Physical paths minimize integrated cost S = ∫J(x(t))dt
4. **A4 (Information Is Physical)**: Every bit costs E_coh = 0.090 eV in ledger currency
5. **A5 (Conservation of Recognition Flow)**: Cost density obeys continuity equation ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·J = 0
6. **A6 (Self-Similarity Across Scale)**: Configurations repeat at scales separated by φ^n
7. **A7 (Zero Free Parameters)**: All quantities derive from axioms or count recognition events
8. **A8 (Finite Ledger Cycle Time)**: Recognition flows settle to zero after exactly 8 ticks

## Physical Constants & Primitives

### CODATA Universal Constants
- ℏ = 1.054571817×10^-34 J·s (reduced Planck constant)
- c = 299,792,458 m/s (speed of light, exact)
- G = 6.67430×10^-11 m³/(kg·s²) (gravitational constant)

### Mathematical Constants
- φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618033988... (golden ratio)
- φ² = φ + 1 (fundamental identity)
- φ^-1 = φ - 1 (inverse identity)

### Planck Scaffold
- t_P = √(ℏG/c⁵) = 5.391247×10^-44 s (Planck time)
- ℓ_P = ct_P = 1.616255×10^-35 m (Planck length)
- m_P = √(ℏc/G) = 2.176434×10^-8 kg (Planck mass)

### Cost Quantum
- E_coh = 0.090 eV = 1.442×10^-20 J (minimum recognition cost)

## Chronon Hierarchy

### 1. Planck Chronon (τ_P)
- τ_P = 5.391247×10^-44 s
- Fundamental quantum-gravity tick
- No ledger update can resolve shorter intervals

### 2. Single Tick (τ)
- τ = 3.900 ns
- Basic ledger update interval
- Derived from positronium lifetime matching E_coh

### 3. Macro-Chronon (Γ)
- Γ = 8τ = 31.200 ns
- Complete eight-tick audit cycle
- All ledger accounts balance after one macro-chronon

### 4. Quarter-Tick (τ₁/₄)
- τ₁/₄ = τ/4 = 0.975 ns
- FPGA implementation convenience
- Splits tick into "load" and "compute" phases

## Dual-Column Ledger Framework

### Ledger Variables
For each spatial cell i and sub-tick t ∈ {0,...,7}:
- F_i(t) = flow column (costs moving this tick)
- S_i(t) = stock column (costs parked in place)
- Both measured in units of E_coh

### Eight-Tick Audit Cycle
1. **Tick 1**: Debit coin from F (prepare)
2. **Tick 2**: Propagate coin to neighbor (advection)
3. **Tick 3**: Tentative credit in S (write-ahead)
4. **Tick 4**: Parity check (local invertibility)
5. **Tick 5**: Mirror debit from S (conjugate prepare)
6. **Tick 6**: Propagate back to origin (return)
7. **Tick 7**: Tentative credit in F (close loop)
8. **Tick 8**: Commit parity, zero residuals (reset)

### Conservation Laws
- **A1 (Finite Update)**: Only finite cells change per tick
- **A3 (Local Invertibility)**: Tick map U has inverse U^-1
- **A5 (Global Balance)**: Σ(F_i + S_i) conserved over 8 ticks

## Spatial Voxelization

### Voxel Edge Length
- ℓ_v = φ^-12 × ℓ_P ≈ 1.47×10^-37 m
- Golden-ratio scaling ensures φ-ladder compatibility
- Twelve powers below Planck length avoids divergences

### One-Coin Capacity Rule
Each voxel holds exactly one indivisible coin:
- Bulk capacity: C(bulk) = 3/4
- Face capacity: C(face_k) = 1/24 each (k=1,...,6)
- Total: 3/4 + 6×(1/24) = 1

### Face Pressure Dynamics
- Pressure difference ΔP_i drives coin transport
- Maintains one-coin rule across curved spacetime
- Face inequalities trigger next-tick rebalancing

## φ-Ladder Mass Spectrum

### Ladder Rung Formula
- E_r = E_coh × φ^r (energy at rung r)
- Self-similar scaling preserves cost functional
- Integer rungs correspond to stable particles

### Known Particle Rungs
- Electron: r = 32
- Muon: r = 39  
- Tau: r = 44
- Up quark: r = 33
- Down quark: r = 34
- W boson: r = 52
- Z boson: r = 53
- Higgs: r = 58

### Sector Dressing Factors
The manuscript indicates dressing factors derive from ledger pressure, not ad-hoc:
- Lepton sector: B_ℓ from 8-tick vacuum polarization
- Light quark sector: B_light from color flow
- Electroweak sector: B_EW from gauge pressure
- Heavy quark rundown: B_heavy from confinement

**Total**: 5-7 weeks for complete implementation

## Key Challenges

2. **Quark sector**: Confinement and running coupling from cost flow
3. **Conservation proofs**: Ensuring eight-tick cycle preserves global balance
4. **Voxel implementation**: Efficient lattice with one-coin capacity rule
5. **Validation**: Achieving <0.4% accuracy without parameter tuning

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1.1**: Extract and implement all constants
2. **Build incrementally**: Test each module before moving to next
3. **Validate early**: Check conservation laws and symmetries
4. **Document thoroughly**: Ensure reproducibility and understanding
5. **Iterate carefully**: Any parameter tuning violates zero-parameter principle
