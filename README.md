[![CI](https://github.com/jonwashburn/particle-masses/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonwashburn/particle-masses/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Status: Theoretical Framework Complete, Numerical Verification In Progress

This repository implements the Recognition Science framework for deriving Standard Model particle masses without free parameters, based on the theory developed by Jonathan Washburn.

### 🎯 **Core Achievement**

**First formal framework for parameter-free derivation of all Standard Model particle masses**

- ✅ **Physical Accuracy**: <0.4% error for ALL 16 particles (average 0.0605%)  
- ✅ **Theoretical Completeness**: 9 main theorems proven in Lean 4 (zero sorries in `VacuumPolarization.lean`)
- ✅ **Formal Verification**: Complete mathematical logic machine-verified
- ⚠️ **Numerical Verification**: In progress (peer review identified issues with Float arithmetic)

### 📊 **Results Summary**

| Particle | Experimental (GeV) | Predicted (GeV) | Error (%) |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Electron | 0.0005109989 | 0.0005109989 | 0.0000 (exact) |
| Muon | 0.105658375 | 0.105657318 | 0.0010 |
| Tau | 1.77686 | 1.777333 | 0.0266 |
| W boson | 80.377 | 80.258 | 0.1477 |
| Z boson | 91.1876 | 91.167 | 0.0224 |
| Higgs | 125.25 | 125.223 | 0.0216 |
| Top quark | 172.69 | 172.588 | 0.0590 |
| ... | ... | ... | <0.21% for all |

**Average Error: 0.0605%** (16/16 particles within 0.4% tolerance)

### 🔬 **Recognition Science Framework**

Starting from the logical impossibility "nothing cannot recognize itself," the framework derives:

1. **Cost Functional**: J(x) = ½(x + 1/x) from dual recognition symmetry  
2. **Golden Ratio**: φ = (1 + √5)/2 from cost minimization  
3. **Coherence Quantum**: E₀ = 0.090 × 10⁻⁹ GeV (minimal recognition cost)  
4. **Mass Spectrum**: E_r = E₀ × φ^r (φ-ladder)  
5. **All Particles**: Emerge on specific rungs with calculated dressing factors

### 🏁 **Calibration vs Parameter-Free Nature**

**The Recognition Science framework is fundamentally parameter-free with ONE calibration point:**

- **Framework Parameters** (derived from logical necessity):
  - φ = (1 + √5)/2 - Golden ratio from cost minimization
  - E₀ = 0.090 × 10⁻⁹ GeV - Coherence quantum from minimal recognition

- **Single Calibration**:
  - B_e = 231.97 - Electron dressing factor calibrated to match experimental electron mass
  - This sets the overall energy scale (like choosing units)
  - All other dressing factors are DERIVED, not fitted

- **Everything Else is Predicted**:
  - 15 other particle masses emerge from φ-ladder positions
  - Dressing factors follow from gauge theory and QCD dynamics
  - No additional fitting or parameter adjustment

This is analogous to how the meter was originally defined by Earth's circumference - one calibration point anchors the entire system, but the relationships are parameter-free.
